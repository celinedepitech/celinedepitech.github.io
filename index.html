            <h3>Pré-msc</h3>
            <p>
              The Pré-MSc at Epitech start with a "pool" which is a key part of
              the curriculum that has been a tradition since 1999. It consist in
              an intensive 4-month period designed to help students build a
              strong foundation in a fun and challenging environment. During
              this time, we focus on:<br />
              <br />
              Gaining skills in system and network administration,<br />
              <br />
              Mastering object-oriented programming,<br />
              <br />
              Learning the essentials of web development.<br />
              <br />
              After this intensive period, students begin alternating between
              school and work, spending 3 days per week with a company. This can
              be done through an apprenticeship or part-time employment
              contract.

              Became an accountant student while working at McDonald's.
              Unfortunately I couldn't complete my accounting training and
              started working longer hours as a fast food employee. It may
              sounds silly but I truly learnt a lot there.

              Video games are a great way to relax (or not). I mostly enjoy

            <h2>Detective Conan</h2>
            <p>
              Ok now this is a big one and deserves its own category. Detective
              Conan has a special place in my heart. I've started watching the
              anime when I was 6, unfortunately the broadcasting in France was
              halted too soon and the child that I was quickly forgot about it.
              Until I stumbled upon the manga at the supermarket. Since then
              I've read over a hundred volume and watched more than a thousand
              episodes.<br />
              It might not be very popular around here but in its homeland it's
              as big as the biggest manga.<br />
              This manga is well responsible for my love of crime novels,
              detectives, Japan and J-pop.
